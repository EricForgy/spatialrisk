## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Solved problems with the index of vectors in specific situations 
* Written additional test scripts

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of spatialrisk.
All packages that I could install passed.
