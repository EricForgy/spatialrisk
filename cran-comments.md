## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Non UTF-8 character removed from column in nl_gemeente data set. 
* Argument for the number of clusters in maps is added. 
* The column with the name of the region is now called areaname in all data sets. 

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of spatialrisk.
All packages that I could install passed.
