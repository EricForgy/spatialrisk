## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added a function to join coordinates (in terms of longitude and latitude) to the polygon level. This is useful to shade the areas with the highest risks on a choropleth map. 
* Added several maps to the data folder. 

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies of spatialrisk.
All packages that I could install passed.
